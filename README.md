The "movie_recommendations_project.ipynb" file was completed during the Spring of 2023 as a final group project for a data mining course. In this project, we constructed Movie Recommender Systems utilizing the KNN algorithm from the scikit-learn library, the SVD algorithm from the surprise library, and the Apriori algorithm from the mlxtend library.
